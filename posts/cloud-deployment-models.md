# Understanding Cloud Deployment Models

Choosing the right cloud deployment model is essential for successfully running applications in the cloud. The three primary models are:

1. **Public Cloud**  
   Services are offered over the public internet. This model is cost-effective and highly scalable, making it a good option for startups or organizations that require flexibility.

2. **Private Cloud**  
   Dedicated to a single organization, a private cloud offers greater control and security. It’s ideal for businesses that have strict regulatory or compliance requirements.

3. **Hybrid Cloud**  
   Combining public and private clouds, a hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds—cost savings from the public cloud while maintaining control over sensitive workloads in a private environment.

Evaluating your organization’s needs will help you select the model that aligns with your security requirements, budget, and performance goals.
