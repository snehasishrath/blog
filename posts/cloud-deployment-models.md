# Understanding Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models define how cloud services are made available to users. The main models are:

## Public Cloud

- Services are offered over the public internet.
- Cost-effective and scalable.

## Private Cloud

- Dedicated to a single organization.
- Offers greater control and security.

## Hybrid Cloud

- Combines public and private clouds.
- Provides flexibility and optimized resource usage.

Choosing the right model depends on your organization's needs and goals.
