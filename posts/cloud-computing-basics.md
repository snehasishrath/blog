# Cloud Computing Basics

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet, providing the flexibility to scale quickly and pay only for what you use. Instead of purchasing and maintaining your own servers, databases, or networking gear, you can access these services through a cloud provider.

## Key Benefits

- **Scalability** – Easily adjust resources up or down based on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency** – No large upfront investments in hardware; pay only for what you consume.
- **Accessibility** – Connect from anywhere with an internet connection.

Embracing cloud computing lets organizations innovate faster, reduce operational costs, and focus on building value instead of managing infrastructure.
